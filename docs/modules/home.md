## What is a module?
A module is a piece of code that can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, giving or removing a feature to OpenBlocks.

So, there are 5 Important Types of modules in OpenBlocks: (we'll add more soon)
- `PROJECT_MANAGER`: Manages where the projects are located, are written, and are read.
- `PROJECT_PARSER`: Parses files (that you can get from `PROJECT_MANAGER`) into a Layout, and Code.
- `PROJECT_GUI_LAYOUT`: Displays a View that allow the user to visualize / edit the layout.
- `PROJECT_GUI_CODE`: Displays a View that allow the user to visualize / edit the Code.
- `PROJECT_COMPILER`: Compiles the Layout and Code into a single ready-to-install APK file.
- `BLOCKS_COLLECTION`: Collection of blocks that will later be used in the code editor

OpenBlocks need atleast one module of each type for it to work as these modules are important.

So, yeah, after reading this, OpenBlocks is just a simple structure, where the features came from modules.

## What's cool with it?
You see, Most apps are not dynamic, they just works on how they were built, giving the user have no control of the features / issues of the app. With this modular approach, users can create features as they like, Do what they want!
