Create your own app in android using block programming like scratch! What is OpenBlocks? OpenBlocks is a community-driven modular android application that can create android apps using block programming like scratch. Every components of OpenBlocks are modules, these modules can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, giving users freedom on what they want to do with this app. Create cusomizeable blocks, Custom widgets, Custom manager, Custom project type, Custom everything, Anything you want with it! For Sketchware users... OpenBlocks is basically an app that you can mod easily! It's open source, change what you want, contribute what you want, use what you want! It's also modular, meaning you can create modules to do something else, For example, I want to add a TextInputLayout to my Layout editor, just download an already-existing module that adds TextInputLayout to the layout editor, and boom! That's it, No need to mod sketchware. And if you want to create a module, we have already made an interface for that, check out openblocks-module-interface , the guide is also there, check out it's wiki page . This documentation is open source, you can contribute to it on GitHub . Happy coding!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#what-is-openblocks","text":"OpenBlocks is a community-driven modular android application that can create android apps using block programming like scratch.

A module is a piece of code that can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, giving or removing a feature to OpenBlocks. So, there are 5 Important Types of modules in OpenBlocks: (we'll add more soon) - PROJECT_MANAGER : Manages where the projects are located, are written, and are read. - PROJECT_PARSER : Parses files (that you can get from PROJECT_MANAGER ) into a Layout, and Code. - PROJECT_GUI_LAYOUT : Displays a View that allow the user to visualize / edit the layout. - PROJECT_GUI_CODE : Displays a View that allow the user to visualize / edit the Code. - PROJECT_COMPILER : Compiles the Layout and Code into a single ready-to-install APK file. - BLOCKS_COLLECTION : Collection of blocks that will later be used in the code editor OpenBlocks need atleast one module of each type for it to work as these modules are important. So, yeah, after reading this, OpenBlocks is just a simple structure, where the features came from modules. What's cool with it? You see, Most apps are not dynamic, they just works on how they were built, giving the user have no control of the features / issues of the app. With this modular approach, users can create features as they like, Do what they want!","title":"What is a module?"},{"location":"modules/home/#what-is-a-module","text":"A module is a piece of code that can be loaded and unloaded at runtime, giving or removing a feature to OpenBlocks.
